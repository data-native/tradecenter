# Data Native Cloud
The web portal presents collections of content around developing cloud native data driven applications using modern techstacks. 

Topics covered are organized around main questions:
* How do you design applications to create dynamic, contextual insights for ttheir audience around data
* How do you create a scalable, efficient and cost optimal data management backend for such applications
* How do you effectively spread the workloads across both the client and the backend to support the main target of creating a contextualized, responsive experience for your audience

The web portal will support users in diving into the content by supporting:
* Hosting a tech blog centered around the main topics
* Showcasing collections of self produced video series and links to curated videos
* Build itself out of self created sample components that are build in a series of video coding series highlighting core elements of modern data driven application design
* Provide a section of content reviews on relevant books, courses and teachings available online

This project is maintained primarily as a reference for learning and will always stay incomplete and work in progress. 

I strongly welcome any kind of productive feedback through PRs or issues if you feel content is not complete, can be improved upon or is straight out based on my wrong understanding of a complex matter. 

Feel free to contact me at any time if you want to request further features to be added, or just pick it up and add them yourself right now.
