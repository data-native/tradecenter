# Episode 1 – Cost optimization basics

### TLDR
Use the cloud to secure fast scalability and independence of upfront investments during the early stages of your business/product and move to dedicated models once you can predict loads reliably. Consider data storage costs early on and factor in your egress costs for data retrieval. The more scale you can achieve, and the more predictable your workloads become, the less benefit cloud will provide you. Be prepared to also move off if required.

In this article we discuss:
*	How the cloud cost model developed and what impact it has on your business
*	How it can put you in jeopardy if your business model is unaligned with it
*	Key steps to take in order to set up a cost-optimized workload in the cloud

Cloud services enable you to provision the right sized infrastructure for your needs at any time, bring up short-lived testing environments, scale down to near zero and rebuild your complete application in the case of a serious accident. It moves your costs from investments with complex planning upfront to operational expenditures that scale as your business grows. It empowers your engineers to access just the right resources at the right time reducing time spend on workloads and increasing flexibility and developer productivity. 

## Costing in the cloud
Cloud providers virtualize underlying hardware to provide you a level of services based on your demands, from renting individual commodity hardware or bespoke high-performance instances in an IaaS (Infra as service) to deploying applications such as databases (PaaS) or running your CRM system on the cloud in a SaaS (Software as service) model. 

As Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others grew an ever-expanding global reach in their networks, they discovered that their scale could be used to provide lower-cost services for a multitude of businesses, relieving them from the pain to manage their own infrastructure. Cost models moved from an upfront provisioning, maintaining, and replacing model (before) to a pay-per-use model. They build up cost savings based on an economy of scale, in which the resources became cheaper as the amount they managed grew. 

Why the cloud can cost you dearly
If you run your services in the cloud as a direct relation to customer value created, and your business model accounts for the variety of usage patterns you will see you should be fine. 

The problem starts, if you don’t account for the full spectrum of costs you will incur to service your clients, or your business model does not accurately predict the way your users will utilize the service. This can lead to your operational costs overrunning your customer bill, resulting in a net loss on your service which can bankrupt your business quickly as you scale. Especially dramatic, if you run a web-based business in which you can have high amounts of fast user signups resulting in your deficiencies in your model exploding on you in no time. 

So be aware of all costs, plan your business model accordingly, and ensure you place proper monitoring to catch misbehaving users in your model and make the right business choices to ensure you run a profitable, stable business on the cloud. 

## Cost-optimize your workload
Optimizing cost is an ongoing process in the cloud in response to learning more about the services offered to help you, as well as you becoming more aware as to your specific requirements. 

In order to manage a cost optimal workload in the cloud let's develop a set of skills: 
* Cloud Financial Management practices
* Expenditure and usage awareness
* Utilizing cost effective resources
* Managing demand and supply resources
* Conduct optimzation over time

### Cloud financial management
You need to get familiar with the usage billing concepts that apply in the cloud and 
adapt your operations accordingly. 
* Adopt a consumption model and design your processes to utilize resources only when required.Don't let anything hang around underutilized.
* Measure your efficiency to relate your business output to the workloads and associated costs. Tracking this data helps you to identify improvement areas 
in output, functionality or cost. 
* Calculate overall cost of ownership for services and be real about the actual costs of running your services out of cloud. Also include opportunity costs in your organization as a result of spending time on undifferentiated operations instead of delivering features to your customers.
* Attribute costs where they originate and optimize your revenue streams accordingly.

### Expenditure awareness
Being aware at every point in time what costs you are incurring, how these costs are related to your business operations and how they project is key to optimizing your costs. If you are not aware of your costs, there is nothing you can do as an organization to manage them effectively. 

* Utilize the build in services to effectively monitor expenses
* Attribute them to your workloads
* Relate them to business objectives 
* Use automation to optimize utilization 

### Utilize cost effective resources
Make use of the vast amount of services and infrastructure offerings available to right-size to your needs.
Decide how much controll you require over the infrastructure, pass on heavy lifting to managed services and define the required memory and compute needs for each service independtly to supply just the right resource. 

* Become aware of the infrastructure offerings (VMs, storage, disk, network) and their capabilities
* Specifically understand the cost performance trade-offs for VMs and storage solutions
* Understand the network billing model, especially egress charges and when they apply
* If you have a hybrid scenario with on-prem resources or users, be very mindful of latency/cost tradeoffs with network connectivity options
* Study dedicated resource costing models and be real about your abbility to predict future loads

### Manage demand and supply resources
Your abbility to design for fast scalability in response to changes in your workload demand will heavily impact your costing.
Cloud cost models are designed to provide you just-in-time resources for a higher price point as you can have them for predictable long-running jobs, with the benefit of reducing the amount of wastage through over- or under provisioning. 

* Learn to analyze your workload to predict repeatable patterns of demand, the rate of change, and the amount of change 
* Control your demand to reduce the requests send to your applications resulting in costs
* Design your services to scale to demand fast and efficiently

### Continously optimize
Use available services to learn about new services and offerings from your cloud provider as the cost difference will continually increase as services age.

* Keep current with announcements from the annual release events such as AWS Re:Invent, Microsoft Ignite and others
* Utilize summary channels on Youtube and others to gain compact insights on your tech stack
* Work with your technical support teams from your cloud provider to learn about improvement options for your application
